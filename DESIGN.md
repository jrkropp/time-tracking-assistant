# Design Documentation
## What is this document?

This is a design record that captures the **why** behind a significant architecture decision in the OpenAI Responses manifold. It is not a how-to guide and does not explain implementation details or usage. The goal is to document context, decision, alternatives, trade-offs, and acceptance criteria so future contributors understand the rationale.

How this document is structured:

* **Questions** frame the decision and its context.
* **Answers** describe the intent and rationale, not implementation steps.
* **Scope** is limited to design motivations and consequences.
